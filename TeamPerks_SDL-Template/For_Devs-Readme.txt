Also, it goes without saying that everyone has some (and more) role in programming our game.



Just to make sure our project is in sync with everyone in the team, please follow these guidelines (which will be updated as we progress) - 

1.	STANDARD NOMENCLATURE / Naming Convention
	Everyone will follow the same nomenclature for coding which will be set eventually. All of us need to code uniformly 
	without using the rookie techniques such as 'int i...' and ClassName 'nameOfSpriteEnemy12345.....'
	This is a basic practice for any sort of programming and will be followed at all times.

2.	COMMENTS!
	There need not be much explaination here as most of you know it is always better to comment as much as possible wherever it is needed. 
	Again, standard coding practice and extremely important.

3.	MODULARITY
	This is an extremely helpful way for understanding the entire code.
	When using different modules for even the basic functions, we can separate out most of the code which should be reusable, saving most of the time and lines of code
	It also makes it easier for me to integrate your modules in the repo and immediately debug in case of any error without hampering anyone else's code.
	All of the OOP's concepts will be thoroughly followed.

4.	AGILE METHODOLOGY (preferred SDLC)
	For game programming, we will be following Agile methodology. This is to ensure that at all milestones set by our instructor, we have a presentable build
	Also by this, we can think more realistically and restructure our GDD if need be. During our meetings, I will explain about this if anyone needs to know what exactly has to be done here.

5.	KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR SCOPE
	Here, we will always help anyone when needed. So it is ok to tell us if you feel the assigned task can be a bit of burden and will be more harder than anticipated.
	Allocation of task and it's required time will be adjusted and made sure that everyone will eventually come on the same line without getting overwhelmed.

6.	SUGGESTIONS
	I am always open for suggestions in case anyone can provide it to optimize the strategy set.
